# Unity - Dreameaters

3D First-Person Shooter game made in Unity.

In Dreameaters you are a small dream-eating ghost, exploring the night for some tasty dream to feast on.
You finally find your prey, a sound asleep kid, probably dreaming about scary clowns, when... you realise that other ghosts like you ended up in the same room as you, and just as hungry as you are.

It's time to fight for survival (and gluttony)!
Only the winner will eat!

**Game still under development!**
